Welcome to the OpenViper repository! Here you will find all of the work that I have done for my F-16 sim project and all of the files. I'll keep the documentation as up to date as I can, but I'm a busy full-time college aerospace student. If a file is missing that you think should be there, or you want more information than I provide, send me an email at Hudsonj.reynolds@gmail.com.

For each of the panels, I provide both f3d files and STEP files. The f3d files are the most versatile and should allow you to edit any features of the panels to your desire. I have also included the STEP files for those using other CAD software. In the future I may include PDF / DXF files to allow straight to laser cutting. 

As part of my project, I have spare PCB's and components for some things. If you want a PCB and don't want to buy a whole set (most manufacturers sell in sets of 5 or so), feel free to send me an email and I'll send one your way for about the cost of shipping if I have any left over.

For all of the panels, M4 x 10 bolts (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09TKVYDJN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) are used to hold the panels together. For each panel to attach to the base structure, I used M5 x 12 wood screws (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09LYR1J2J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). You could, of course, use something more akin to a DZUS connector, but for me it doesn't matter much. The panel is designed in such a way that it could be modified to accomodate DZUS fasteners.

As for the actual panels, I use 3mm acrylic lasercut. My approach is very similar to that used by the Warthog Project, so that's a good resource for more info. This is the acyrlic I use (Acrylic https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B084T7BS8L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). The white, translucent, and black provide a good amount of backlighting to come through while also diffusing well. Cheaper sources are available in bulk if you're doing a large amount of panels at once.

For the lighting, I place LED's on a PCB which is placed directly behind the panels. These panels generally held in place by the switches. These are the LED's I use (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077XDN49X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1). Of course, other options can and will work, but I have designed my circuits with a forward voltage of ~ 3V in mind. Each of the resistors on the PCB's are 150 ohm. These are the ones I used (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QKBRP9D/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

With those resources, you should be able to get started. For any element of the project that requires more than this, I'll include a seperate readme for that component with a BOM and parts that I used. I want to end this short introduction with a disclaimer. This is an open-sourced project that is (currently) only run by me. Build the components at your own risk, I cannot guarantee that they will be of the utmost quality or will not break in the future.

With that said, I hope this resource is helpful for at least someone out there! Best of luck on your simpit journey. Fly Safe!
